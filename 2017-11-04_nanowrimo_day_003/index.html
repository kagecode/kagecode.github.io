<p>Day 3 did not start well, I sat down and had no idea of what to write about. It took me almost an hour but I finally had an idea and, for my surprise, writing the words for the day was surprisingly easy.</p>

<p>I think this is further evidence that waiting for inspiration to strike is a very efficient way of writing nothing, sit down long enough and some idea will come, it may not be the best idea in the world but it is an idea, and that&rsquo;s what you need to start.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came across s serious problem with my story, my main character has no initiative, or much of a personality. I find this odd because the other characters seem to be fine, I feel like I know then much better then I know my protagonist. Have someone come across a problem like that?</p>

<p>Today I will try to write my protagonist doing something, anything! Maybe forcing myself to write that will help me find her voice&hellip; If everything fails maybe a I will change the main character, but I don&rsquo;t want to do it, not yet.</p>

<p>Problems apart I am proud of myself, I even a little bit ahead of the necessary word count!</p>

<p>P.S. I fixed the NaNoWriMo word count, that was nothing wrong with the site, I was just being an idiot.</p>
