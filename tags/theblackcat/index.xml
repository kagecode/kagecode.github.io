      <description>Most people use computers to write nowadays, and that make a lot of sense. For me, though, writing on a computer is a bit difficult, I get bored and distracted very easily and in a computer, where the whole of the Internet is a click away, I am not able to be very productive&amp;hellip;
So I have decided to write my NaNoWriMo novel by hand! Seeing the letters form on the page, with some music on the background, seems to be enough to keep my brain entertained while I write, and the lack of distractions help a lot.</description>

      <description>This is my first idea for the cover of my novel, what do you think about it? I should probably be working on the story instead of the cover but the empty rectangle on the NoNoWriMo page was annoying me&amp;hellip;
This year I will be a Pantser! No time to waste with outlines, raw untamed creativity is the way to go, MUAHAHAAHHAHAHA!
This is the synopsis of what I am thinking about writing.</description>
